* ## Abstract. ðŸ“”

This repository was created in order to make available a tutorial that is useful for all those people who are lovers of Information Technologies. The tutorial provides the steps to work with Docusaurus version 2. Addressing topics from the preparation of the necessary requirements to proceed with the installation. Then we will address aspects of the project description, identification of the main components. And finally we will conclude with the deployment of our work locally to create a github page.

Documenting is a way of showing what is done so that other people can learn, modify, create, design and share. Although it is important to mention that documenting can be a complicated task. Which can trigger a project to reach its full potential. But thanks to Docusaurus our task can be greatly simplified.
With Docusaurus you help us create and maintain websites where we can display our documentation. Thanks to the implementation of React.js, we can have support for blogs, pages with custom designs with very elegant and dynamic styles.
