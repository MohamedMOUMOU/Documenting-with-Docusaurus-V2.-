* ## Abstract. ðŸ“”

This repository was created in order to make available a tutorial that is useful for all those people who are lovers of Information Technologies. The tutorial provides the steps to work with Docusaurus version 2. Addressing topics from the preparation of the necessary requirements to proceed with the installation. Then we will address aspects of the project description, identification of the main components. And finally we will conclude with the deployment of our work locally to create a github page.

Documenting is a way of showing what is done so that other people can learn, modify, create, design and share. Although it is important to mention that documenting can be a complicated task. Which can trigger a project to reach its full potential. But thanks to Docusaurus our task can be greatly simplified.
With Docusaurus you help us create and maintain websites where we can display our documentation. Thanks to the implementation of React.js, we can have support for blogs, pages with custom designs with very elegant and dynamic styles.

2. Enter the folder created from the preferred terminal (Gitbash, cmd, etc.)
3. Execute the **npx @docusaurus/init@next init [name] "[template]"** instruction, where [name] should be replaced by whatever name we want and [template] by classic to use the page for default to be uploaded to the website. Docusaurus has the availability of using various templates such as: facebook, bootstrap and so on.

* ## Deploying the Application. ðŸ“¦

5. To run Docusaurus we use the following command from the terminal: ** npm run start ** and our project will be displayed in our web browser with the address **http://localhost:3000**. If you want, you can also run this other command from the terminal: **yarn run start**. In either case, the two commands performing the same operation of displaying our website in the browser that we have by default. Although if you wish you can also use any other browser.
